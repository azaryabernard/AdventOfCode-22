# Advent Of Code 2022

## About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Installation

I will be mainly using Haskell.
For Haskell, I've used a Stack project structure inside each daily challenges, using GHC 9.4.2
After installing Stack and the needed dependencies, run it with:

```bash
stack build && stack exec main
```

For C-based programming language (C/C++/ASM), I've added the Makefile inside each project
To compile the code for ARM64 MacOS, you need to use:

```bash
arch -x86_64 make
```
